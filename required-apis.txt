This file outlines the external APIs and services required for the website to function correctly.

To make the entire website fully operational, you will need to enable the following APIs in your Google Cloud / Firebase project.

1.  **Firebase Services:**
    These are used for the website's backend, including form submissions and file storage. You can enable them directly from the Firebase console.

    *   **Firestore Database API:**
        - **Purpose:** Stores all data from the "Contact Us" and "Order" forms.
        - **How to Enable:** Go to your Firebase project, click on "Firestore Database" in the left menu, and follow the setup instructions to create a database.

    *   **Cloud Storage for Firebase API:**
        - **Purpose:** Stores all file uploads, such as the GST certificates submitted through the "Order" form.
        - **How to Enable:** Go to your Firebase project, click on "Storage" in the left menu, and follow the setup instructions.

2.  **Google AI Services (for Genkit):**
    This is used to power the AI Chatbot feature.

    *   **Vertex AI API (or Google AI for Developers API):**
        - **Purpose:** This API gives the chatbot access to Google's Gemini models, which it uses to understand questions and provide answers. The Genkit framework on this site is configured to use this.
        - **How to Enable:** This is typically enabled automatically when you create a Google Cloud project associated with your Firebase project. You will need to get an API key from Google AI Studio (https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) and add it to your `.env` file as `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.

**Summary of Steps:**

1.  Create a Firebase project.
2.  Enable Firestore and Storage within that project.
3.  Copy your Firebase web app configuration keys into the `.env` file.
4.  Generate a Google AI API Key from AI Studio.
5.  Add the Google AI API key to your `.env` file.

Once these steps are complete, all features of the website will be fully functional.
